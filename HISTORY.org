** angular or not
Originally I thought it would be easiest to just create a REST api
using liberator and use angular on the client. This can be achieved
dead-easy by just using the [[https://github.com/ShaneKilkelly/lein-angular-template][lein angular template]]. This introduces a
whole slew of new dependencies such as grunt for building,
coffescript, etc. However at the moment it doesn't seem clear to me
that the current requirements warrant this complexity. I think we
should go with the mantra that /simplicity always trumps complexity/
and just go with a dead-simple web app for now. We can always
introduce more advanced technologies later. That's the nice thing
about this approach. Nothing is fixed, all the technologies can be
used at your own convenience.
