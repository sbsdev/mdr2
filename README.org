** Documentation
At its core mdr2 integrates a number of systems and coordinates the
production of DAISY Talking Books from inception through to archiving.

The involved systems are:

- ABACUS ::  Order management and initiation of productions is
             typically done in the erp namely ABACUS.
- Library ::  Some production orders come directly from the library as
              they are not managed in the erp.
- Obi :: The actual recording of the production is done in obi.
- DAISY Pipeline :: The recorded productions are validated and
                    converted to DAISY Talking Books using software
                    from both the DAISY Pipeline 1 and DAISY Pipeline
                    2 projects
- Archive :: Once all the artifacts have been created they are
             archived in a legacy in-house archive.
